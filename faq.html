                            <p>Once your photo session is completed the file is sent to the printer. That takes about 1 second. The printer then processes the file and begins printing, and that takes about 10 seconds. By the time the print is in your hand it is under 12 seconds total. The most common thing we hear after we hand someone their print is "Oh, wow… That was fast!"</p>

                            <p>Typically we arrive 1 hour prior to the agreed upon start time. This allows us time to find a spot for the photo booth to be set up, unload, and initialize the photo booth. We are set up in about 45 minutes. You never pay for setup or teardown of the equipment.</p>

                            <p>Each event has a custom made template. We design them in house 1-2 weeks before your event. If you have a special logo (like from a wedding invite) or a colour scheme in mind, let us know and we can incorporate that into the template. Once we create the first draft we will send you a copy to review at which point you can let us know what you think. Sometimes we nail it on the first shot, others we will have to go back and make some adjustments. Once you're happy with the final product, we upload it to the photo booth for your day!</p>

They perform all the set up and take down of the photo booth and can tend to any issues that may crop up.</p>

                            <p>Photo booths are quite popular and we have a fixed number of weekends in any given year, so ideally you book as early as you can. We currently offer multiple photo booths which means we can often accommodate a "last minute" booking. With that said, we still need to create a template for you and that can take some time.

                            <p>Yes! We can provide multiple photo booths at the same event, which is especially useful for trade shows or large events where the guest count is high, or if there is a time constraint. This allows us to process double or triple the number of guests in the same time frame. We can also have booths running at the same time over multiple locations if the client is running concurrent events. Contact us to discuss your specific needs and we'll create a custom solution for your event.</p>
